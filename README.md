# Minesweeper-Clone

Welcome to Minesweeper Clone. This was a personal project I was working on using JavaFX
and a [YouTube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwcyxuKko_M) that I was trying to add features to.

## Dependencies
- [JavaFX](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

## How To Run
1. Clone the repository and go into the resultant folder
```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/grivera64/Minesweeper-Clone.git
$ cd Minesweeper-Clone
```

2. Compile MinesweeperApplication.java
```bash
$ javac --module-path <your path to JavaFX> --add-modules javafx.controls MinesweeperApplication.java
```

3. Run the resultant MinesweeperApplication file
```bash
$ java --module-path <your path to JavaFX> --add-modules javafx.controls MinesweeperApplication
```

And you're done!
